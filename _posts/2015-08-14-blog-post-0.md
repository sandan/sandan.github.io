With this new AI hype, I couldn't pass the chance to finally get back to writing and self-studying mathematics. It wasn't AI by itself that got me interested again. It was a programming language called `lean` (`lean4` at the time of writing). I'm no stranger to programming and have used AI to accelerate prototype code to understand a project better (constraints, requirements, the structure of the interfaces, and implementation details). Mathematicians have a similar thing where they have proof ideas. A proof idea has the seeds. You work on the idea until it bears fruit. Then you can share it in academic journals and it may become a seed for another proof. If the final proof is complicated, it probably looks very different from the proof idea.

I tried my hand at this after graduating with an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. I would spend time after work reading undergraduate texts and doing my own research. I kept revisiting my proof ideas and would have a good grasp on the techniques used which helped to also deepen my understanding. I didn't have a TA or professor to grade my work so I was my own proof checker. I took a number theory course in IBL that gave me the confidence to do this on my own. That class encouraged independent critical thinking and communicating ideas to others in the class and collaboration. I don't think I really encountered anything that required a complex proof. I had a feeling that my proofs or proof ideas were correct or would lead to the right direction.

But with `lean`, I can formalize my proofs. I just had to learn the language and translate my proofs. With this, I have guard rails that I can use to keep going on my journey into more complicated areas. With the advent of AI, it becomes even more powerful. It could suggest hints, examples, resources to learn more, or different perspectives. I'm in no pressure to get the "right" answer. It's simply because of my own curiosity.

> Mathematics teaching will become more abstract - emphasizing critical thinking, reasoning, creativity, and experimentation

I can see middle schools where kids come up with their own conjectures, share them with the class, and spending time coming up with counterexamples or proofs in euclidean geometry, natural, integers, and rational numbers. 
I can see high school students doing the same thing but in a broader world exploring real numbers, complex numbers, 
I can see graduate schools where mathematical research becomes teams building whole new theories on top of existing ones in classes and explaining the main results of their theory.

In this future, there will no longer be doubt about a proof (i.e. Shinichi Mochizuki). There will be more time spent on problems that students actually care about that will help teach or extend the essence of a mathematical idea. The journey is still there and that is where the learning lies - whether it's learning about something existing or new. The result will be an acceleration of results and new applications.

In the background of all of this of course will be `lean` or some computable way to compile a proof for correctness. An AI partner to help the student through a personalized socratic method.

> "The Spectre of Error"

AI could be wrong. `lean` could have bugs. This could have far reaching consequences. However, mathematics can still fall back to critical thinking and reasoning. These are skills that will be needed regardless. We should not blindly trust. That attitude of skepticism is there but also a positive mindset that is willing to "try and see".

> "Whose thoughts am I using?"

Thinking further, I thought about posting my sessions in a blog format. I could have the AI help me in writing a post and linking the session here. I tried it out thinking about the future of mathematics in this new world. It suggested a manifesto with bold predictions. But these were not my own and the predictions didn't seem very surprising nor interesting (at least to me). I'm sure I could have prompted the AI to be more bold - but then I thought "Whose thoughts am I using?". In addition, I could have written this post and asked the AI to just finish it. 

I could have linked any conversation I had with an AI. It may not have been the original but altered slightly (using less specific or demanding prompts) to give the impression that I added something. My point is that if someone links an AI conversation - they want you to think that's the conversation they had. There were probably prior ideas the author/prompter had and the AI conversation is just a link in their narrative to get you to believe something.

The AI stands on the shoulders of a giant dataset. No doubt there are great thinkers it has probably (hopefully) been trained on but I value my own thoughts because this post is really a way of expressing myself - it is my blog. Of course, I learn over time and perhaps the views I have may change. My predictions could be wildly wrong and if they interest me, I'll write about those too. It's the journey after all. The reflective process that separates us from AI. 

Writing this blog post myself vs. reviewing one. I'm not sure the character of the post would be the same. In a world where $P \neq NP$, verifying an answer is different from devising an algorithm to generate an answer. The former is a computation, the latter is somehow more. 

> "What is human understanding?"

Writing vs. reviewing and editing vs. performing

I identify best as a writer. I like the freedom to express my thoughts in any order I wish, to re-arrange, to add new topics, remove old topics. I like the idea of a first draft and iterating. This takes more time depending on the writer. There is also the role of performer - in this case, a vlogger. In a vlog, I think you have to linearize your thoughts or at least have a narrative that's easy for the listener to follow. A vlog could easily become a podcast. Then there is the editor. As a writer, I am also edit my own work (the iterative part).

Now the prompter uses the AI to generate content and then prompts the AI again to edit. I think this can be tedious as well. There's a book in Borges' library somewhere that will satisfy what you want but what are the chances the AI will find it or even get close to it?

> "My Mathematical Journey Ahead"

So what does this mean for my own path? I plan to use this blog as a record of my mathematical explorations. Each post will document a concept I'm wrestling with, a proof I'm formalizing in `lean`, or a connection I've discovered between different areas. I want to capture not just the final understanding, but the messy process of getting there - the false starts, the moments of confusion, the sudden clarity.

I'm particularly interested in exploring how formalization changes the way I think about mathematics. Does translating a proof into `lean` reveal gaps in my understanding? Does it suggest new directions for exploration? How does the constraint of having to satisfy a proof checker affect my intuition?

These are questions I can only answer by doing the work. And that's what excites me most - the doing. Not the final polished result, but the daily practice of thinking mathematically, of wrestling with ideas, of building understanding step by step.

> "A Prediction and a Promise"

Here's my prediction: In ten years, we'll look back at this moment as the beginning of a renaissance in mathematical education and research. Not because AI will solve all our problems, but because tools like `lean` will democratize access to rigorous mathematical thinking. The barrier to entry for serious mathematical work will lower, and more people will discover the joy of mathematical exploration.

But this will only happen if we resist the temptation to let AI do the thinking for us. The value isn't in the destination - it's in the journey of understanding. And that journey is irreducibly human.

This blog is my commitment to that journey. To thinking my own thoughts, working through my own confusions, and sharing the process authentically. If you're on a similar path, I hope these posts will be useful companions along the way.

If you read this far, I am grateful. I hope it got you thinking about the future of mathematics as well - and maybe inspired you to start your own journey of mathematical exploration. The tools are there, waiting. The question is: what will you discover?
