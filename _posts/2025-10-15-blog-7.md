In our `Propositions` series we have covered `Prop`, compound expressions of propositions (conjunction, disjunction, exclusive-or, implication, bi-implication, negation), and rules for how to prove them. In this next series on quantifiers, we will learn what they are and how to prove statements involving them.

Quantifiers allow us to express statements such as:
- There exists a number x that satisifes a certain property. 
- There is a unique s that satisfies a ceratin property.
- For all elements in the set, each satisfies a property.
