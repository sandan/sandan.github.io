Let us begin with propositions. Lean4's proof approach reminds me of the approach taken in ["Language, Logic, and " by](https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/lpl-index.html). I highly recommend this book and the software supplement. The software supplements (Boole, Fitch and Tarski's World) gave me my first taste of a computer-assisted approach to learning. The instant feedback (guard-rails), visualizations accompanying the proof, and availability (I could learn as much as I wanted and whenever) made the learning experience enjoyable.

I am using Lean4 with the VS Code editor so that the proof is outlined in the InfoView panel (right). As I type Lean4 code in the editor panel (left). Here is an example:

The proof state is updated until goal(s) are reached. Do not worry what all of this means yet.

# Proof in Lean 4
Let's break down the syntax and semantics of a theorem in Lean4:
```
theorem p3 (p q : Prop) (h1 : p) (h2 : q) : p âˆ§ q := by
  constructor -- and introduction
  Â· exact h1
  Â· exact h2
```
The sections of a theorem correspond to:
- Theorem: declares a theorem with a given name. In this case, we use "p3". In mathematics, theorems are given more interesting names. For the purposes of introducing the mechanics of Lean4 the name of the theorems we will be working on are not important. I presume the reader has had some exposure to formal logic. If you do, you will recognize this as the conjunction introduction rule.
- Domain: specifies the domain (type) in which the terms in the theorem belong to. In this case, `p` and `q` are in `Prop` (set of propositions -statements that evaluate to either True or False).
- Hypotheses: specifies what is given to help prove the goal(s). In this case, `h1` and `h2` specify hypotheses. Namely that `p` and `q` are True. Over the course of the proof, you are able to add hypotheses. We'll see how to do that later.
- Goal: specifies a claim to be proven. In this case, `p âˆ§ q`. This means prove that `p` is true ***and*** `q` is true. 
- Proof: a sequence of steps that lead to the Goal. These are driven by tactics. The proof begins with the `by` keyword. The `constructor` tactic takes the goal (`p âˆ§ q`) and splits it into two cases to prove - namely `p` and `q`. We see this in the InfoView panel.

Note: The QED in Lean4 is shown as 'Goals Accomplished'. When a goal is proved, ðŸŽ‰ is shown in the editor. This is configurable in the settings.

# Tactics
These are commands that tell Lean4 to construct expressions. They drive the progress of the proof in tactic mode. They can be used in different contexts to add or rewrite the terms in the proof, introduce new goals, solve goals, and more. Here are some common ones that we'll use in this blog post series:
- exact
- have
- constructor
- cases
- left, right
- apply
- intro
- push_neg
- by_contra
- contrapose
- assumption
- tauto
- contradiction

It may be common to look up a tactic but I find asking an AI along with examples of usage easier. So that is the first thing I suggest you do. Fire up Lean4 and start proving your first theorems. In the next blog post, I'll share some that I found useful.

# Blog stuff
Posts that have a lean4 tag will usually have lean4 code that is used to prove something in tactic mode. Rarely will I include the InfoView panel so it will help to try out these examples yourself. The best way to learn is by doing. I will try to keep the posts bite-sized. I reserve the right to edit the posts. You can always check the github repository for the latest updates and the history of each file. Happy proving!
