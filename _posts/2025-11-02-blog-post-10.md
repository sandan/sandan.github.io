Now that we have a handle on universal and existential quantification, we can look at propositions that involve both. In the previous posts on Quantifiers, a quantifier applied to a single variable. This is the case in this post but now we allow two quantifiers each applied to their own variable.

- ∃x ∃y P(x, y)
- ∀x ∀y P(x, y)
- ∃x ∀y P(x, y)
- ∀x ∃y P(x, y)

Prenex form writes all the quantifiers in the beginning of the sentence.

The order of the quantifiers makes a difference
