Now that we are acquainted with the existential and universal quantifiers, we'll look at how negation interacts with each of them.

## Negation of Universal quantifier

¬(∀x P(x)) ≡ ∃x ¬P(x)

In words: the negation of "for all x, P(x)" is "there exists an x for which P(x) is false."  
Example: "Not all swans are white" ≡ "There exists a swan that is not white."  
Lesson: To refute a universal claim produce a single counterexample. When you move a negation past ∀, flip it to ∃ and push the negation inside.

## Negation of Existential quantifier

¬(∃x P(x)) ≡ ∀x ¬P(x)

In words: the negation of "there exists an x with P(x)" is "for every x, P(x) is false."  
Example: "There is no even prime greater than 2" ≡ "For every even number, it is not prime (or no even number > 2 is prime)."  
Lesson: To prove a negated existential, show a property holds for all elements (often via a general argument). Note: on an empty domain ∀-statements are vacuously true, so ¬∃ is true there.

## De Morgan's Laws with quantifiers

Negation distributes over logical connectives inside quantifiers using De Morgan flips:

- ¬(∀x (P(x) ∧ Q(x))) ≡ ∃x (¬P(x) ∨ ¬Q(x))  
- ¬(∃x (P(x) ∨ Q(x))) ≡ ∀x (¬P(x) ∧ ¬Q(x))

Example: Negating "Every student passed both exams" yields "There is a student who failed at least one exam."  
Lesson: Systematically move negation inward by (1) flipping ∀↔∃, and (2) applying De Morgan to logical connectives. This is essential for forming precise counterexamples, constructing contrapositives, and performing proof by contradiction.
