# Thought Enumeration

The blog is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://academicpages.github.io/).

# Development
## Running locally

When you are initially working on your website, it is very useful to be able to preview the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub. To work locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above.

## Using Docker

Working from a different OS, or just want to avoid installing dependencies? You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a container that will run the site for you if you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

You can build and execute the container by running the following command in the repository:

```bash
chmod -R 777 .
docker compose up
```

You should now be able to access the website from `localhost:4000`.

### Using the DevContainer in VS Code

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you can use the [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) that comes with this Repository. Normally VS Code detects that a development container configuration is available and asks you if you want to use the container. If this doesn't happen you can manually start the container by **F1->DevContainer: Reopen in Container**. This restarts your VS Code in the container and automatically hosts your academic page locally on http://localhost:4000. All changes will be updated live to that page after a few seconds.
